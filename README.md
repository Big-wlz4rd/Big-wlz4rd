As of right now I am a systems administrator working for AFSOC as a DoD Contractor. My main thing is SCCM. I use a LOT of scripts in my daily tasks. I will be posting my scripts,
that have helped me. Maybe you will find them useful or not. Also to go back and track my progression. ðŸŒ´ Here's to growth. ðŸŒ´

I'm trying to get more into a DEVOPS role or become a power platform developer. I really do pefer the Windows ecosystem and enjoy it more than anything. I got my taste 
of powerapps when I was administrating a M365 environment and was asked to help create some stuff with the powerapps stack. I really did enjoy doing that along with patching our hybrid
environment.
